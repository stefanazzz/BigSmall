Contains fortran simulation code and plotting python routine

1) Copy fpar_model1 to fpar to run code with specific parmaters of model1, same for fpar_model2.
2) Edit fpar to modify the parameters as desired.
3) create a RES folder to store results. RES_model1 and RES_model2 folders contain pre-computed numerical results as shown in paper
4) compile fortran code (see Makefile for compilation) and un the code
5) python routine read_plot_dimensionless.py plots both numerical results and analytical solution
Note:
Deeper changes can be done by editing the source code in subroutines of fault2dPML.f
Increase size of arrays in arrays.f
PMLpack.f contains treatment for absorbing boundaries, in principle leave as is.
